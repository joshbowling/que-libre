# Dief
Oddly a word for a thief in english, this word was used to describe this particular, former orphanage that the owners that may have ran a child brothel disguised as an orphanage. Of course I have no proof of this, it's fucking Mexico. I can tell you that once a week or so, a random person would show up with a donation. 

Further adding to the lore, we were told by a local that the proprietors of said rape-orphanage would bring extra kids in when they knew outsiders were coming.

Clearly I have no idea whether any of this happened and I don't believe anyone anywhere could disprove it besides the owners. I can tell you this much, they can't be trusted for nearly every month they increased the rent or came up with some other low-rolling thug reason to extract extra money from the #raelites.
