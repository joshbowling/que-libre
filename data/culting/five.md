# Erica & Ezekiel

Everyday at 10am, I attended the groups' meeting. Erica usually took this opportunity to sit on a bench that overlooks the gulley and rolling mountains beyond. The wind always blew across the gulley. The breath of God? Erica thought so. In early days, she learned to use it as a way to pick a page in the bible to start reading.

I came to where the wind always blows and found her.

> Josh, they're wrong. This isn't happening anytime soon. We're going to be here for at least 7 years.

> What?

> Look here, the wind turned to [#ezekiel-36-thru-39](./appendices/ezekiel-36-thru-39.md). See:

	* 8.'But you, O mountains of Israel, will produce branches and fruit for my people Israel, for they will soon come home. 9 I am concerned for you and will look on you with favor; you will be plowed and sown, 10 and I will multiply the number of people upon you, even the whole house of Israel. The towns will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. 11 I will increase the number of men and animals upon you, and they will be fruitful and become numerous. I will settle people on you as in the past and will make you prosper more than before. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 12 I will cause people, my people Israel, to walk upon you. They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance; you will never again deprive them of their children. *
> This sounds like it's already happened, right?
> Yeah.
