# 2 - Raelity
#### The Archbishop of Mexico
Erica arranged for the #archbishop-of-mexico to meet us near our hotel this morning. As we pull out of the #rosarita-beach-hotel parking lot we notice portly early-twenty-something wearing a ballcap, black t-shirt, black shorts, and Adidas shower flops trying to flag us down. I immediately wonder who the fuck. But, Erica tells me ~~this~~ he's our contact, the unceremonious #international-congregation-of-lord-rael's #archbishop-of-mexico. He coulda been Deep Roy in an umpalumpa outfit and we would've welcomed him with all pomp and circumstance of the ~~Poop~~ [#pope](./appendices/pope.md).
I found the nearest parking spot and bopped out of the car real quick to shake hands. Of course, we had no idea who the other was -- Erica had been our mutual point of contact as I despised social networks at the time. I agreed to follow him to [#sanctuary](./appendices/sanctuary.md). 

#### What the Fuck Have We Done?
Heading east, away from the shore, the terrain inclines into and turns from touristic to what passes for residential. This happens in the course of about a quarter mile. As soon as that quarter mile is up, so is the road in any meaningful sense. Mere traversed dirt with scores of vicious swear-to-god sharpened stones in your path. Any of them are enough to pop your tire. I wish that was all.
I grew up poor where poor and this place was the ultimate reminder of poor as a relative term. The shacks and shanties we passed in pursuit of [#sanctuary](./appendices/sanctuary.md) were the poorest shit either one of us had either seen. Sick to the stomach for a #million-reasons not the least of which is a question that grows louder as it echoes off the completely fucking empty skull sitting on top of you neck: What the fuck have we done?

#### Onward.
It's too late now isn't it? And the world is ending, isn't it? And #raelity will protect us, won't it? Up and down hills, marks of desparate poverty, #the-fear-of-the-culture, gang symbols, trash, innumerable #semi-stray-~~gods~~dogs.
And finally, when you think you can't get anymore fucking remote or twisted up, down another hill, we hang a right into [#sanctuary](./appendices/sanctuary.md) guarded by a wall with a broke ass gate. This isn't a metaphor.

#### Welcome Home Sanctuary
I was still in a sickened daze when I got out of the car. I had never seen a sanctuary before; right then, it looked more like a gringo refugee camp made up of a gymasium that sat next to the parking lot a garden directly in front but sitting 4 feet lower of said lot, a mess hall to the right of the garden, a cemented area containing a 10-15 person picnic table, stairs leading toward a coutryard which sat between two rows of dormatories. All of said building were made of cinder block passably with white paint.

 To the left, in the distance was a grand mesa whose sight still inspires memories, its magestic spectre, portending mysticism. There's much more in due course. At present however, I have to snap out of it and greet the people who are my new brothers, sisters, and community. Everyone one was an American, almost all of them were [#clergy -- link not working yet](./appendices/ecclesiastical-order.md) of seemingly various backgrounds. But quite honestly, Erica and I already had enough to think about. We had quite a trip, it was really great meeting all of you and we thank you so much for your hospitalty. Fellowship at 4? We'll be back tomorrow, I think we need to rest today.

We left with partly aghast, partly disappointed, wholly stunned. We went back to our comfortable little hotel room and enjoyed the fact that we felt utterly safe outside of America. After sneaking back in the with #kitty-the-~~god~~dog, we ordered more room service, tacos el dorado please, and delicious #mexican-coke. The girlie watched TV en espanol, cartoons are good no matter the language, she's interesting like that. Erica and I sat out on the #balcony and watched the tides trail into the blue extending all the way to the horizon. We couldn't say here forever, but the now was comforting after what we just witnessed. Few words of any meaning passed between us the rest of the day.

#### Work?
Yeah, I still had a job. I told them I was gone on a family emergency in Baja California. This isn't far from the truth, it isn't far from a lie. Nevertheless, Thursday morning I plopped myself down in front of my computer to get some work done. After all, life in Mexico wasn't even cheap, nevermind free. I calculated we could stay in the hotel for as long as we wanted, perhaps even look for an apartment or something. Having never been to a #developing-country, I had never used #developing-internet at a hotel. I was in for surprise. It was so slow and unstable, got nothing done for 6 sweaty-palmed, nervry hours. Nothing. I told myself it was cool because I was still dealing with a family emergency and got ready to go to our 4PM fellowship at the sanctuary.

#### May God's Love Be With You
Friday morning I was fired. I shamelessly cried begged and pleaded as Erica and the girlie were at the #pancake-house next to the hotel. I was wrong. They were out the door listening. She and I both knew #raelity was sinking in. We didn't dwell on it, we moved on. I wish I could report we did this out of faith and high-mindedness. But, in fact, we were in midst of learning something new about #rosarito-beach, it was a weekend getaway for many southern Californians making weekday vacancies cheap and easy to find. Starting on Friday, the price was triple. We got an extra hour before checkout and somberly packed the fucking tarp full of ~~shit~~ possessions again. Took our dirty-ass car and set out to our new home, [#sanctuary](./appendices/sanctuary.md).

#### Communal Living
The #raelites graciously accepted us and had already cleaned out our room (Because Erica, girlie, and me were an individual family we got our own dormitory, the only other members with their own room were the #vicar and the #seer). In this case a dorm consisted of a 12x20 cinder-block room with whitish walls painted many filthy, likely strange, possibly violent, and defnitely sad events ago. Time is all psychlogical here. 
The left wall of our dorm has a doorway with no door, had been ripped of hinges at some point exposing a dungeonesque room, about 8 x 12, with two mop-style sink basins that had running water -- only about half structures had running water and all of them were dirty-doesn't-cover-it unless you cleaned them yourself, right before you used them. 
As I mentioned earlier, they cleaned out their room, as many of you know clean is a concept and concepts don't exist and thus are relativistic and propagandistic. Please don't take this as me being unappreciative. I'd later find out that this room was full-to-the-ceiling of "donations" that had been left to rot. I'm sure you can still find some of this rot cascading down a nearby gulley, but I get ahead of myself.
Beyond clearing the room of these donations, they had also swept and mopped, placed three used beds & frames, bedding that had doubtless been part of aforementioned donations. This was our new home. Erica doesn't cry, Erica is way too tough to cry, way tougher than me for sure.

#### What Do You Know Abuout The Dollar Store?
There's some cheaply made, poorly conceived, retail nonsense in American dollar stores. You could list all the things wrong with it, or right for that matter. This I promise you: [#mexican-dollar-stores](./appendices/mexican-dollar-stores.md) are only-and-over-stocked with shit that even American dollar stores don't `yet` have the gall to stock and hock. This notwithstanding, there isn't much in the way of retail right around rosarito beach. But we stuck close by as driving anywhere meant running in military road blocks where gringos are no doubt targets. We went through three of these and we're flagged to stop at all of them. 
	And these soldiers -- either their terrified of or sponsored by the cartels -- the cartels are the real government #el-chapo for presidente! Erica told me regularly that I'm too white, this is what got us pulled over. It took me a while to really figure out that meant in application. I can tell you that I was terrified anytime I saw a the [#policia-municipal](./appendices/policia-municipal.md).
We found what we needed to clean our dorm. We found a old bookshelf in one of many apocalyptic piles of fallout that occupied the area between the gulley and our new residence.

#### Josh & Erica feed ~~5,000~~ 16
Erica and I, while overwhelmed, were still very happy to be on the cusp of our primary purpose here, to learn what these #holy-individuals could teach, take in what they could tell us, and be a part of the community to the extent it was possible. Sure, they weren't great cleaners, but I'm not either and so much worse when bachelor. As we were walking out of the ~~dollar~~ peso store we spied a carneceria, meat shop, and decided to pop in and pick up some chicken drums to make for our first communal dinner. Many of my first-world friends, and their wives, would've ran out of these places screaming, swearing off meat, and lathered themselves in anti-bacterial gel. They aren't clean, but nothing is here. Cross fingers, pray to #rael, and cook well. 
My first #baja-mexico-fire, I learned that fire is definitely a spirit of the land upon which it dances. The land here is so barren -- it couldn't support life without importing it. I heard from a #raelian-deacon, let's call him #enki, that the Mexican government had damned up the water that used to flow through here, causing erosion of topsoil, drought and the consequent gummy dust that caked to everything `the perfect camo for our car, even mexicans thought we couldn't afford a hot turd at lunchtime which served us very well in one of our run-ins with #policia-municipal`. #enki told me he was going to demand the mexican goverment release the waters or face apocalypse -- I don't know if he ever did this, but I would've love to see it for it would've been either beautiful or catastrophic, such is the life #suffering-servants. If this proposed atrocity had any affect on the land's fire, it was good one. I've never seen such fire, the wind was almost always blowing forceful which made it hard to start unless you had some apocalytic leavings with which to build a windshield -- #big-ass-check-mark. I erected my refuse shield and started my first #baja-mexico-fire. Handy me, I also found an old #whats-the-word grill grate and fashioned a setting for it by bending some of the abundant rebar. I struck it -- a total all-consuming lunatic, burning more blue than orange and cussing, frothing, moshing in the wind. It charred the outer drums crispy dark and all the hair off my grilling hand. This epitomized grilled chicken -- the best I've ever grilled was with the help of the #baja-mexico's #fire-soul.
My new brethren enjoyed it, though #samson, the rotund #archbishop-of-mexico thought is was undercooked. He was also given to abrupt and startling visions of grandeur around the bonfire where he informed us he can't wait to be loved by millions after #new-jerusalem is revealed, post-apocalyptically of course. This isn't criticism for mis-apprehended beliefs -- that would be too rich indeed.

#### Powerless Nights
There's no doubt that sweltering is what you do most of the day, especially since the power lines end about 200 feet shy of the [#dief](./appendices/dief.md). Interestingly, it's wired, but no power line? I heard that the owner of the [#dief](./appendices/dief.md) actually ripped the power line up. I'll even speculate as to why: the wiring in the structures was complete shit and he didn't want to repair, nor have his property damaged. This is all hearsay, though -- what else are you going to find in Mexico, proof `...chuckles`?
But yes, 200 ft shy, perfect metaphor for the pervasive pettiness of the locale. Oddly, pettiness takes away, but it also giveth -- pettiness would be pissed off if it knew this. In particular it gave the darkness which yielded the most amazing nightscapes; the first of which we enjoyed after this, our commemorative day at #sanctuary. If the milkyway has never been your primary source of light, then can't possibly imagine the beauty it imbues every moment which you gaze at it or dance (ahem metaphorically) under it. This was one of the only sources of [#truth](./appendices/truth.md) I was to find while I was there.

I believe it was #kent who started the bonfire that night. Erica, in particular, asked questions: 

	has anyone met lord rayel? 
	no, but we're in communication with him.
---
	Is there anything more than the #lord-rayel-youtube-videos? 
	There's much more, says #john, It's all disclosed in time.
---
	Are you all worried about being out here, it seems like pretty dangerous country?
	We have protection, #john points to the sky.
---
	You mean #rael?
	Yes, definitely. But also the #anunaki. We're safe here, trust me.
---
	What are the #anunaki?
	It's the race the seeded humans to mine gold and #enlil is in charge of the planet and #enlil is #rael.
---

Also, [#john](./appendices/john.md) tells us things are going to start happening fast, we're lucky to have gotten out of [#babylon](./appendices/babylon.md). He expects the border to be shut down soon and for martial law to go into affect. Indeed, #john claims they we have a lot of work to do in preparation. The lord has given us a design for a free energy device, #john continues. #enki is working on it, would you like to help, josh? Sure, I'd be happy to.

Erica keeps her eye on information and presses
	Is there anything we can read?
	The Bible, especially the books that were left out, and the Gospel of Angelus, the books of Zecharia Sitchin. We also have a school for clergy, we might be able to get you into that at the right time. 

[#kent](./appendices/kent.md) tells us there's a meeting every morning around 10AM to discuss what will be done today. After that we can follow them to the internet cafe.

We got some answers for the night. The conversation wanes, the fire dies. We go to our dorm. It hasn't cooled off much yet. We open all four of the windows we have and spray ourselves down with deet. Amazing in the desert they're plenty of mosquitos when grey water from the showers run out mere feet away form open windows. We put girlie in the tent we brought so she doesn't get bit.

Erica makes a list of everything we need to try to find tomorrow to make this place more livable. This is list she'll make and remake. We pray.
