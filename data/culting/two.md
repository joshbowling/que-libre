#### The Archbishop of Mexico
Erica arranged for the #archbishop-of-mexico to meet us near our hotel this morning. As we pull out of the #rosarita-beach-hotel parking lot we notice portly early-twenty-something wearing a ballcap, black t-shirt, black shorts, and Adidas shower flops trying to flag us down. I immediately wonder who the fuck. But, Erica tells me ~this~ he's our contact, the unceremonious #international-congregation-of-lord-rael's archbishop-of-mexico. He coulda been Deep Roy in an umpalumpa outfit and we would've welcomed him with all pomp and circumstance of the ~Poop~ [#pope](./appendices/pope.md).
I found the nearest parking spot and bopped out of the car real quick to shake hands. Of course, we had no idea who the other was -- Erica had been our mutual point of contact as I despised social networks at the time. I agreed to follow him to #sanctuary. 

#### What the Fuck Have We Done?
Heading east, away from the shore, the terrain inclines into and turns from touristic to what passes for residential. This happens in the course of about a quarter mile. As soon as that quarter mile is up, so is the road in any meaningful sense. Mere traversed dirt with scores of vicious swear-to-god sharpened stones in your path. Any of them are enough to pop your tire. I wish that was all.
I grew up poor where poor and this place was the ultimate reminder of poor as a relative term. The shacks and shanties we passed in pursuit of #sanctuary were the poorest shit either one of us had either seen. Sick to the stomach for a #million-reasons not the least of which is a question that grows louder as it echoes off the completely fucking empty skull sitting on top of you neck: What the fuck have we done?

#### Onward.
It's too late now isn't it? And the world is ending, isn't it? And #raelity will protect us, won't it? Up and down hills, marks of desparate poverty, #the-fear-of-the-culture, gang symbols, trash, innumerable #semi-stray-~gods~dogs.
And finally, when you think you can't get anymore fucking remote or twisted up, down another hill, we hang a right into #sanctuary guarded by a wall with a broke ass gate. This isn't a metaphor.
