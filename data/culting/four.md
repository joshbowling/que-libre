# 4 Leedskalnin
#chris talked to me about pursuing wind and solar in addition to the prometheus device, but nothing had materialized. He didn't seem especially committed to one way or another. We went to the #internet-cafe to do some research of our own.
> To many, I realize this would seems completely preposterous: I, a non-electrical engineer or really even a strong sense of physics, would attempt this. One of the best things about other people's thoughts are they belong to other people.
I found many videos on youtube proclaiming to have made magnetic flywheels, the most coherent to me were based on #magnetic-current by #edward-leedskalnin. So I found a copy online, got a sense of the materials that I need and spent many hours disassembling old electronics I found in the many piles of abused objects strewn between the gulley and the dorms. I unwound copper for days trying to find 3,000 turns of insulated copper to wind around a U-Shaped length of rebar.

With these items ~~I~~ someone should be able to make a #perpetual-motion-holder. I was under the assumption that I could use a number of these, 24 perhaps,(as well as a family of other components) to create a wheel that would spin perpetually. If so, then I was aiming to hook this wheel up to a busted generator's crankshaft and see if it would spin.

If I recall correctly, each prong of the U was 18" long. I calculated that I need 24 for each flywheel which means I would need 72,000 turns of wire and at least 48 neodynium magnets along with some other equipment that I'd yet to identify being that I hadn't made even 1 of 

But first I needed to make
