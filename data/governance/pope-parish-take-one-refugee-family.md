# Pope Francis Runs the Old-School Papal Playbook #
How many religions has Catholicism consumed? How many Saint's are there? How many ceremonies, liturgies, rules?

### Pope Francis wants Catholicism to consume secularism. ### 
You can see this very clearly in his positions on abortion and gay marriage. 

### Pope Francis wants Catholicism to consume Islam. ### He's made it okay for Muslim Prayer to be held in the Vatican. Soon enough, he'll call for Mohammed to become a saint -- just keep watching.

### Pope Francis wants all national culture to be eradicated, allowing for a one-world government & one-world religion to flourish. ###
  * He's called for every parish to take in at least one family of refugees.
  * He's called for catholic households to take in refugees.
  * He's called rejection of illegal immigrants xenophobic and racist. What do these statements necessarily mean? 
    * That if your country has meaningful borders, you and your countrymen are xenophobic AND racist! Thus, the only way you could un-be xenophobic and racist is to remove any meaning from national borders. This will of course remove all specific culture from locales over time.

**Catholicism has never meaningfully changed. The pope seeks to expand the influence of Catholicism by consuming or destroying any competing ideology. All this while he can't even keep his employees from touching children. All this while the Vatican gets richer and the parishoners get poorer.**
