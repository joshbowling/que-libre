The first US National Bank was chartered, via legislative process, in 1791. The charter was only for 20 years.

Fast-forward 20 years... It's 1811 and 70% of the bank was owned by foreign investors (read Great Britain). So the votes were cast as follows:
  * Senate 17-17 (against-for)
  * House 65-64 (against-for)
  * VP 1 (against)
  Thus, there was no more US Bank to be owned by foreign interests...

  What happens in 1812?? Google it.
