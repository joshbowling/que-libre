Jim: experience of the eternal is the alpha and omega, the a to z, experience of the eternal isn't a weekend spritual retreat or a 30 minute meditation, because it doesn't stop or start by its very definition.

Bob: how do you experience the eternal?

Jim: I'd have to ask you how you think you would know whether you had or had not experienced the eternal?

Bob: What do you mean?

Jim: We describe experience to ourselves through memory, right?

Bob: Continue...

Jim: So our memory, in composition, is views of experience over time?

Bob: Go on and we'll see, perhaps...

Jim: If you're with me so far, then this means we can't remember the timeless itself.

Bob: Perhaps it would just mean we would remember it differently?

Jim: Okay, then could you compare the two "kinds" of memory in terms of time?

Bob: No.

Jim: So you could experience the eternal at the same time as an instant, if you could perceive acutely enough (notice I didn't say finitely) then you could remember it, right?

Bob: Yes.

Jim: And you could remember it as having "taken place" in the smallest or largest of moments?

Bob: It would seem so.
